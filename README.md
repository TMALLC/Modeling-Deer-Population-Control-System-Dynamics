Hunting is the primary method for deer population management in West Virginia. West Virginia
Department of Natural Resources (WVDNR) evaluates and sets harvest management goals on a yearly
basis. In this paper we aim to develop and analyze a system of time‐dependent ordinary differential
models in‐order to better understand the dynamics of the white‐tailed deer population in West Virginia
and the difference in effectiveness of any combination of harvesting methods that ultimately minimize
the negative economic consequences caused by overpopulation for all six districts in West Virginia and
maintain a healthy equilibrium for the future white‐tailed deer population.
